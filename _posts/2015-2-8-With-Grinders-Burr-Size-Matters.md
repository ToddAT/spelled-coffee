title: Note to Self - With Grinders, Burr Size Matters
categories: [notes to self, grinders]

Posts show up frequently in [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/), and elsewhere I'm sure, asking about grinder purchase advice. Most often, it comes down to budget and preference for manual or automatic operation. However, if I'm interested purely in the quality of the grinder output, what I'm most interested in is the size of the burrs.

I know that someone somewhere understands the science behind how the size of the grinder burrs effect the output coffee grinds but I'm not going to pretend that I have calculated the precise [gravitivity and polarity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfWc47SEPA0#t=173) that control the difference. I can only say, from my own experience, that it does.

Commercial grinders universally use large, beefy, burrs.  I'm sure a reason, maybe the biggest reason, for this is probably simply to process the largest amount of beans in the shortest amount of time. However, intended or not, the larger burrs also result in more uniform grounds. More uniform grounds are going to result in more uniform extractions which will result in better reflection of flavors in the cup.

The above very official sounding logic has not, in any way, been fact-checked. That said, I think it's clear from my own experience as well as those found in forums such as [CoffeeGeek](http://www.coffeegeek.com), [Home Barista](http://www.home-barista.com), and elsewhere, that the commercial grinders with the largest burrs tend to produce the best coffee in the cup (*see the [Titan Grinder Project](http://www.home-barista.com/reviews/titan-grinder-project-t4126.html) threads for extremely detailed discussion about this*).

The bottom line of all this is that, going back to the theoretical response to a theoretical question about grinder recommendations, a commercial grinder is almost always recommended if budget allows and the reason is the burr size. Commercial units are not designed for home use, they tend to waste vast amounts of coffee beans through their regular operation, and often require modifications to fit vertically on many counter-tops. In other words, other than the superior burrs, there isn't really a reason for a home user to think of adopting one.

Thus, it isn't surprising that the darlings of the home grinder world, the [Lido 2](http://www.oehandgrinders.com/OE-LIDO-2-Manual-Coffee-Grinder_p_14.html), the [Pharos](http://www.oehandgrinders.com/OE-Pharos-Manual-Coffee-Grinder_p_15.html), and others, equip themselves with the largest burrs they can manage. It isn't an accident that those grinders are often the first ones to be recommended or that they outperform most other home grinders-- it's the burrs. It's all about the burrs.

According to Fortune, Starbucks is starting [a high-end coffee subscription plan](http://fortune.com/2015/02/17/starbucks-coffee-delivery/).

Per the article:

>The coffee shop chain said Tuesday it plans to offer subscription delivery of “reserve” coffees — a service that will cost $288 annually for 12 shipments of 8.8-ounce bags of coffee.

At $24 for ~9 ounces of coffee, it might be a hard sell unless Starbucks scores some really serious beans. They've certainly got the muscle to do it but they're also fighting the serious negative mind-share they've accrued in the enthusiast coffee world. Not to say that they can't do it but it'll be an uphill climb for sure.

Myself, I'm not a huge fan of the subscription services in general-- my drinking and buying habits just don't seem to line up with the plans and, as a result, I feel handcuffed by them more than I feel liberated. That said, I guess more competition in that space can't be considered a bad thing, particularly if it provides yet another reason for Starbucks to improve its roasting practices.

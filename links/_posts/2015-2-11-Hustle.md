Matt Perger, champion barista and roaster, has started a website over at [baristahustle.com](http://baristahustle.com) to disseminate "free, advanced, and relevant information for baristas".

From the website:

>The Hustle will be a free weekly email that details a concept, technique, product or otherwise that helps Baristas. Iâ€™ll be dabbling in articles, podcasts, videos, downloads and anything I can think of to get the message across...

As of this posting, there are two editions posted. I only read the first one, "[Coffee Extraction and How to Taste It](http://baristahustle.com/coffee-extraction-and-how-to-taste-it/)",  I can't speak for the barista target audience but, as an enthusiast amateur barista, I found it informative and useful.

The primary method of distribution is an email subscription. However, posts are archived on the site. If you're like me and wary of signing up for yet another email newsletter, the site does support an [RSS feed](http://baristahustle.com/feed/).

I'm interested to see how this project progresses as it goes forward.  As far as resources go, it looks like a great place to bookmark, at least, and might well be worth a free email sign-up.

>Consumption of a dark roast coffee decreases the level of spontaneous DNA strand breaks...

I have no idea what it means but [SCIENCE!!](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24740588)

From the abstract:

>**RESULTS:** At baseline, both groups exhibited a similar level of spontaneous DNA strand breaks. In the intervention phase, spontaneous DNA strand breaks slightly increased in the control (water only) group whereas they significantly decreased in the coffee group, leading to a 27 % difference within both arms (p = 0.0002)... The consumption of the study coffee substantially lowered the level of spontaneous DNA strand breaks in WBC.

That's gotta be good, right? I'll take it.

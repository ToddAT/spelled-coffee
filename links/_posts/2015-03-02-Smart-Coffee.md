As of this writing, the official page hasn't been updated with the results but there's a [nice write-up on Sprudge](http://sprudge.com/charles-babinski-wins-2015-us-barista-championship.html).

I'm much less familiar with Mr. Babinski's work as a barista and shop owner than I am with his role in [the ChefSteps series of videos on espresso](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLny_wEI6iwNd9TX-97ZiND6VCmwJ7XFgq) which I highly recommend. Kudos to him for the win!

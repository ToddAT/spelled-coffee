It's part of a series called "Smart Coffee for Regular Joes". Judging by this piece and the title of the series, it's aimed squarely at coffee drinkers who either haven't started or have just begun to delve down the enthusiast rabbit hole. For that purpose, I think these are great as the more educated coffee drinkers are out there, the better for everyone interested in better coffee.

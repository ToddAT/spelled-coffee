Today's victim is Benjamin Zeman of [Mocha Joe's Roasting Co](http://mochajoes.com/).

## [*Me*] Before we get started, what's your name, company, and title?

>[Ben]  Benjamin Zeman, Mocha Joe's Roasting Co., Equipment Tech, Consultant and Projects Manager.

## 1. What do you do, how long have you done it, and how did you get started?

>My role in the company is primarily an equipment tech for 100+ wholesale accounts and a consultant. I'm also a projects manager who organizes and oversees tasks within the company and solves everyday problems outside of just equipment. I've been working in the Industry for about 7 years now.

>I got started working for Mocha Joe's when the roasting shop hit its busy season and they were looking for some part-time help packaging coffee. I put in a few shifts to help out a friend who was managing the company at the time and also make some extra cash. On my last day of packaging the owner asked me a question, “Can you fix things?” I immediately thought he wanted help fixing his computer because that’s what most people ask me to fix because I've been doing it on the side since I was a teenager. So I said, “Yes, I can fix things.”

>Turns out he was looking for someone to fix coffee equipment and espresso machines. He brought me over to a machine on the counter and asked me a couple of questions. I took a quick look and the machine made basic sense to me so we talked about how I might go about fixing it. I guess I did alright because he offered me a job.

## 2. What's your favorite bean right now and how are you brewing it?

>This is a hard question to answer because I'm doing a lot of QC and trying a lot of different coffees through a lot of different brew systems. One of my favorites at the moment is our [Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Borboya](http://mochajoes.com/products/copy-of-ethiopia-yirgacheffe-borboya) brewed at home with a Chemex and Kone filter. I use 205 F water from a Bonivita Variable Temp Kettle and 19.8g of coffee for 12oz of water. I'm also really enjoying our [Cameroon Oku](http://mochajoes.com/products/cameroon-oku) which is a really special project for us. I prefer that through a pour over like a Hario with a paper filter or a Bonavita brewer.

## 3. What do you like most about the coffee industry right now?

>I like that companies are getting more and more involved at origin and building up new, mutually beneficial relationships with people. I also like that companies and industry people are sharing knowledge more freely than in the past.

## 4. What do you like least about the coffee industry right now?

>Even though people seem to be sharing more frequently there is a still a lack of resources for things like roasting techniques. I'd like to see larger databases of free information and more scientific testing and experiments.

## 5. What would you like the average end-consumer to know about what you do that you don't think they know already?

>This is more for businesses than people brewing at home but if you don't clean your equipment and call in a tech for regular maintenance, your equipment won't last as long and will produce an inferior product. It's like bringing your car in to a mechanic. You can wait until it breaks and end up paying a lot more or you can bring it in for preventative maintenance regularly and things will be much better.

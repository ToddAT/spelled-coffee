## [*Me*] Before we get started, what's your name, company, and title?

>[Casey]  Casey Blanche, Just Coffee, Director of Coffee.

## 1. What do you do, how long have you done it, and how did you get started?

>I am in charge of sourcing, roasting, purchasing, quality control, inventory, and product development.  I’ve been working in coffee for over 10 years.  I started as a barista and worked my way up.

## 2. What's your favorite bean right now and how are you brewing it?

>My favorite coffee right now is the soon to be released Ecuador auction-lot #4. I prefer cupping this coffee to brewing it so I can savor its aroma.

## 3. What do you like most about the coffee industry right now?

>I like that the industry is finally getting serious about highlighting, discovering and preserving unique coffee varietals.

## 4. What do you like least about the coffee industry right now?

>There are so many, it’s hard to determine exactly. I wish flavored coffee would just die already and go away. I get agitated when I hear people use the term direct trade to market their coffee when they never traveled to origin (their importer did). I wish the organic coffee market was bigger because pesticides harm people and the environment. I get upset when I see start-ups marketing themselves as high end specialty coffee roasters when you know they just learned how to roast last week.

## 5. What would you like the average end-consumer to know about what you do that you don't think they know already?

>I travel the world to find the best coffees and I take a lot of pride in what I do. I have a “Jiro dreams of Sushi” dedication to my work. Every coffee is meticulously profiled to highlight its best flavor characteristics. I operate two small batch roasters, a Diedrich and a Loring, and chose the roasting technology that works best with the type of coffee I am roasting. I stand be hind my coffee and would put my offerings up against any roaster.

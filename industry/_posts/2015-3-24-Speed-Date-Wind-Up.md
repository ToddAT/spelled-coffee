## [*Me*] Before we get started, what's your name, company, and title?

>[Brian]  Brian, Wind-Up Bird Coffee, Owner and Head Roaster.

## 1. What do you do, how long have you done it, and how did you get started?

>I’m the owner and head roaster of Wind-Up Bird Coffee, a small batch roaster located in Los Angeles. I was an avid home roaster for about six years before deciding to take it to the next level. The decision to make this a business rather than a hobby wasn’t purely driven by my love of roasting, however; I’ve also been interested in entrepreneurship for a while now and had been involved in a tech startup that ultimately failed. That failed startup taught me a lot about getting a business off the ground, as well as the importance of the customer experience, so that really helped shape the way I’ve been approaching Wind-Up Bird Coffee.
> 
>Once I committed to doing this, I partnered with an old friend that has an incredible amount of food and service industry – including specialty coffee – experience. His knowledge has been invaluable and his skill set really compliments mine. 
>
>We launched in October 2014 and have seen sales and repeat customer rate increase month over month so far.  

## 2. What's your favorite bean right now and how are you brewing it?

>I’m in love with the Papua New Guinea Mile High AA we’re currently offering. It took a little while to get the roast level dialed in – to get just the right acidity, really – but now it really sings. It has this awesome candy apple sweetness to it and a nice, syrupy body. I like to brew it with a Chemex because it produces such a clean cup and this bean really benefits from that.

## 3. What do you like most about the coffee industry right now?

>Two things: The focus on ethical practices and sustainability; and everyone’s drive for continual improvement. I find both to be very inspiring.

## 4. What do you like least about the coffee industry right now?

>Probably what everyone in specialty coffee dislikes: K-Cups. I get the convenience factor, I just don’t get the waste.

## 5. What would you like the average end-consumer to know about what you do that you don't think they know already?

>There’s a lot of thought and effort that goes into every bag of coffee we produce. Also, we love feedback, good or bad.

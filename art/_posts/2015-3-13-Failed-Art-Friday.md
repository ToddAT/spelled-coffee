My attempt at a tulip  produced a sad weed withered by disease.

In other news, the milk I bought this week is non-homogonized-- I don't know whether that's a red herring or what but it's been seriously amazing as far as helping me produce some silky smooth micro-foam. Does non-homogonized milk have more fat in it or is the fat in it more accessible? I vigorously shake the carton before I pour so I'm not getting a cup full of milkfat. I swear I've gone non-homogonized before and not had this great run of foaming. Inquires will need to be made.

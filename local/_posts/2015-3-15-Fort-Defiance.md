Iâ€™ve enjoyed going to [Fort Defiance](http://www.fortdefiancebrooklyn.com/) for quite some time now, drawn in by the great Southern-infused food and the imposing portrait of General Zapata hanging on the back wall.

What only occurred to me yesterday as I sat down for brunch was how much I enjoyed their coffee: they've got a pour-over station at the bar at which they brew up Counter Culture beans to order (and order first thing because the process isn't particularly fast). They've got an espresso machine as well but I've never felt the need to try it because their regular cup of joe is so good. And the food's no slouch either. I recommend the All American: two eggs, hash browns, and bacon. And don't forget that cup of coffee.

Eater NY has compiled a list of [21 fine coffee establishments](http://ny.eater.com/maps/best-cafe-coffee-shop-new-york-city-brooklyn-queens) located in NYC.

There's a pretty handy interactive map to help locate the different establishments.

I can't vouch for most of the list, but I've been to and can personally recommend these from the 21 Eater chose, in no particular order:

* [Culture Espresso](http://cultureespresso.com/): awesome chocolate chip cookies the size and density of NHL regulation hockey pucks;
* [Joe \(the art of coffee\)](http://joenewyork.com/): good to go but I don't know any locations that have seating;
* [Cafe Grumpy](http://www.cafegrumpy.com/): great source of local freshly roasted beans;
* [BÚÐIN NYC](http://www.budin-nyc.com/): check out the mod bar espresso machine-- pretty wild, plus you can buy some Nordic roasted beans if you're so inclined;
* [Toby's Estate](http://www.tobysestate.com/): the flatiron shop is connected to a Strand mini-shop and florist;
* [Blue Bottle Coffee](http://bluebottlecoffee.net/): they've expanded to Bryant Park but the Rockefeller Center location might be less hassle... if you can find it;
* [Gimme Coffee](http://gimmecoffee.com/): another good source of locally roasted beans.

>“We already have a coffee shop,” [the landord] said, referring to Tip of the Tongue, located next door... and included in her property. “I want to give them a chance.”

I'm not in that neighborhood much so I haven't been to [Tip of the Tongue](http://www.tipofthetonguebklyn.com) yet but I hope it gets that chance. How long before Starbucks makes a bid on another spot in that neighborbood that the landlord can't refuse?

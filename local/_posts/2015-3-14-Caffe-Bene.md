South Korean megachain Caffebene just opened an outpost not far from my office. I've seen some other of their shops in the city but this was my first time inside one.

It's a nice enough looking place: natural wood interiors, some pasteries, sandwiches, etc. I ordered a small cappuccino and a chocolate croissant.

I can't say I tasted any of those tasting notes mentioned on the guide in that particular drink. It was probably a touch over bitter which is saying something given that milk cures a lot of espresso flavor ills. That said, it wasn't bad, it was quite drinkable, and I would certainly rank it above Starbuck's. It's not going to knock Birch Coffee or Stumptown off my rotation but, in a pinch, or when I don't feel like spending half my life in line, it can tide me over just fine.
